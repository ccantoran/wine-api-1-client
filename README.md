# How It Was Made 
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node w/express on the serverside. 
The reason I decide to make this full stack app was because I wanted to create a starting point for folx who are interested in wine. Before I became a 
sommelier, I remembered how hard it was starting out and how often times I was left guessing or left intimidated by all the resources online. So I decided to 
create an app that would help guide others into the world of wine one bottle at a time! This project is my prototype for my 2.0 version coming soon! My wine app gives 
the user to learn quick facts about a wine they may be interested in but also gives users suggestions if they don't know where to start. The survey/questionnaire asks 
the user their preferences on food/drinks and selects wine that fits the users palette. The end goal of project is to demystify the wine world and to make 
wine more accessible to folx of different socio-economical backgrounds. 

# Optimizations
In my 2.0 version I will be adding more features. I will be adding more of an education piece so that users can understand why they like certain wines and what they 
should look for when they go to their local grocery store. In addition, I will be using react as my framework just to clean up my project a little bit more. I will also 
be expanding the database in MongoDB just so that all options in the questionnaire are covered. 

# Lessons Learned
I learned a whole lot! I learned how to clean up my backend and express! This project also made me more comfortable working with MongoDB Atlas. I also realized it 
was easier to integrate the questionnaire on the client side rather than the server side.
